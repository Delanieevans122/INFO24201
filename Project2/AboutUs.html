    <h2>In the Beginning ...</h2>
    <p>Rent A Pet began with a family that loved dogs. George Smith and his wife Carol owned two Irish Setters. These dogs were pets to the Smith family children and extended family members. One day as George was walking his dogs in the park, he noticed how they attracted the attention of passing women. They seemed to like to stop what they were doing and ask him about his dogs. A young woman remarked that she would love to have a big dog like that to walk, but she had a small apartment and couldn't keep a large dog. This brief encounter was the beginning of an idea.</p>
    <p>What if there were others, possibly many others, who wanted the companionship of pets without the responsibility? Maybe people would be willing to pay to rent or borrow a pet for a short period of time.</p>

    <h2 id="today">Where We Are Today ...</h2>
    <p>After weighing the pros and cons, the Smiths decided to go ahead and start Rent A Pet in the fall of 1980. The business offered its customers the companionship of a pet without all the care, extra expenses, or hassles of ownership. Initially, the business only provided dogs for rent, but since then, Rent A Pet has expanded its offerings to include cats, horses, pigs, and even snakes.</p>

    <h2 id="unique">What Makes Us Unique ...</h2>
    <p>Rent A Pet has expanded from its early location in Provo and now has franchises in Logan, Bountiful, Salt Lake City, and St. George. We employ our own trained vet and have yet to experience any accidents with our rental pets. We also have an animal trainer who works with the dogs and horses daily.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™ve attracted many satisfied customers. The company frequently provides services to senior citizens who reside in retirement homes that prohibit pet ownership. Seniors can enjoy a dog or cat for the day and even take them for a walk. Young men looking to strike up a conversation with young women often rent dogs that enjoy jogging or playing Frisbee. Specially trained trick dogs can be rented for parties or appearances in movies or commercials. The most unusual pet, snakes, are usually rented for Halloween or other occasions where the customer wants them for shock value.</p>
